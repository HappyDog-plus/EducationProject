The anatomical pathway and termination point of the nasolacrimal canal are as follows: 1. **Pathway**: - The nasolacrimal duct begins at the **lacrimal sac**, which is located in the **lacrimal fossa** in the anteromedial portion of the orbital wall. The fossa is bordered by the anterior and posterior lacrimal crests, formed by the frontal process of the maxilla and the lacrimal bone, respectively ([Document 13], [Document 30]). - The duct travels downward, slightly laterally, and posteriorly through the **nasolacrimal canal**, which is formed by the maxilla, lacrimal bone, and inferior nasal concha ([Document 9], [Document 13]). - The duct is approximately **12\u201318 millimeters** in length ([Document 7], [Document 9]). 2. **Termination Point**: - The nasolacrimal duct opens into the **inferior meatus** of the nasal cavity, located beneath the **inferior nasal turbinate** ([Document 1], [Document 3], [Document 7], [Document 9]). - At its termination, the duct is often partially covered by a mucosal fold called the **valve of Hasner**, which prevents the backward flow of nasal contents into the lacrimal system ([Document 3], [Document 7], [Document 13]). In summary, the nasolacrimal canal directs the nasolacrimal duct from the lacrimal sac to the **inferior meatus** of the nasal cavity, where it opens beneath the inferior turbinate, often guarded by the **valve of Hasner**.\n\nHere is the question:\nthe nasolacrimal canal extends into what part of the nose?\n\n\n\nPlease first think step-by-step to analyze all the information in a section named Analysis (## Analysis). Then, please provide your answer choice in a section named Answer (## Answer)."
